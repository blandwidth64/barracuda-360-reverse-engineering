# barracuda-360-reverse-engineering

a work in progress very early steps reverse engineering of the RETAIL winchester (or barracuda) motherboard of the xbox 360 line.

goals: 
  get values for as many smd components (mainly resistors and capacitors) as possible
  scan each pcb layer (6 including the silkscreen layers) at least at 600DPI
  create a boardview in kicad

ambitions:
  recreate the boardview in schematic form
  production-ready pcb (ie little to no drc violations and a MSoft-level of quality, ready to be sent to a fab)

i am not being paid to do this and i have a job so expect it to take a little while. i am also admittedly OK at kicad so the final product will likely be ridden with DRC violations making the final pcb unfit for production. this is first and foremost a research project.
